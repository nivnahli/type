		<p>hello, <div class="new-color"></div>how are you</p>

		<p><div class="new-color">God is dead. We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be. Simplicity, patience, compassion.These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.</div>Be the change that you wish to see in the world.</p>

		<p>everything in the universe is within you </div> <div class="other-font">Nam urna augue, elementum sed felis non, dictum suscipit arcu. Sed rhoncus eu ante in tincidunt.
